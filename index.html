Header:

Hello, I’m Paul.

I write code.
I'm curious, creative, and always learning.
Sometimes I break stuff in the process.

About:

I’m a full-stack web developer. Currently I'm focusing on Javascript and the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js).

I’m passionate about science, technology, and their implications on society. I believe in privacy, freedom, and pushing the boundaries of what’s considered normal and acceptable.

I think the idea of using software as a way of contributing to these wild times we find ourselves living in is really cool.

I love learning new frameworks, software development techniques, and helping others grow and learn. I enjoy collaborating with other people and working as part of a team.

I also love learning and using Linux, BSD, Internet protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, etc.) and server and network administration.

I spend my free time improving my coding skills by working on API and RESTful web application projects.
